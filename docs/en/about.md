[Portage](https://portagenetwork.ca/), [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) (CC) and the [Canadian Association of Research Libraries](http://www.carl-abrc.ca/about-carl/) (CARL) are collaborating to provide a scalable federated platform for digital research data management (RDM) and discovery. They are pleased to announce that the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) service has finished Beta and is now in Limited Production.

The Limited Production version of FRDR will have many of the features and user interface design expected for full launch. Data deposit is currently being offered as a 'by request only' service, subject to resource availability and capacity. If you have a dataset you would like to deposit, please contact support@frdr-dfdr.ca to request permission to deposit.

A <a href="https://demo.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/?locale=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo version</a> of the FRDR site is available for training and testing purposes. The FRDR demo can be used to learn about the platform's search and data deposit features. As much as possible, the demo will be kept up-to-date with the latest version of the FRDR platform. Please note that all data deposited into the demo will be considered "test" data and will only be available temporarily.

## Purpose
FRDR will address a longstanding gap in Canada's research infrastructure by providing a single platform from which research data can be **ingested, curated, preserved, discovered, cited and shared**.

The platform's federated search tool will provide a focal point to discover and access Canadian research data, while the range of services provided by FRDR will help researchers store and manage their data, preserve their research for future use, and comply with institutional and funding agency data management requirements.

## Features

* **Federated storage model**: Individual institutions or organizations can store data and collections locally by connecting their storage into FRDR.
* **Federated support model**: Portage works with data professionals in academic institutions across Canada to provide on-campus support for researchers.
* **Scalable model**: Scalable systems accommodate growth in the adoption of FRDR by researchers and in the amount of data they store.
* **National data discovery**: Data collections hosted in FRDR and in other Canadian data repositories are discoverable through a single federated search tool.
* **Data preservation**: FRDR can automatically create archival packages, with metadata and alternate formats for data that are suitable for long-term preservation.
* **Access control mechanisms**: FRDR supports control over who can discover and access each dataset, including support for embargo periods.
* **Dataset registration**: DOIs are automatically issued and registered to datasets, with licensing arranged through DataCite Canada.

## Project Timeline

* January 2016: The software development project was started, following an earlier pilot project that identified scalability and preservation as key elements of the service that was needed.
* September 2016: Alpha testing of the user interfaces was started thanks to the contribution of discovery interface code developed by the University of British Columbia.
* April 2017: Beta testing was started and the project was put in limited production mode with a small number of research groups.
* August 2019: CANARIE announced $2M of funding to CARL Portage, of which a portion is going towards moving FRDR into full production.

## Geodisy Project

FRDR’s Geodisy map search (beta) is an open source discovery tool that allows users to find open data from Canadian researchers by using an interactive map. Research data can be hard to find, and even harder when looking for data about a specific area or place. Geodisy changes that, giving users a window into the world of research data with map-based tools familiar to everyone. Geodisy currently sources data from [Scholars Portal Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/), which houses material from institutions across Canada. FRDR’s Geodisy will continue to expand upon its collection to include more institutional sources.
