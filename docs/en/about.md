[Portage](https://portagenetwork.ca/), [Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) (CC) and the [Canadian Association of Research Libraries](http://www.carl-abrc.ca/about-carl/) (CARL) are collaborating to provide a scalable federated platform for digital research data management (RDM) and discovery. They are pleased to announce that the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) service has now launched in full production. Anyone can now use FRDR to search for and download data across Canadian repositories and faculty members, or their designates, from Canadian post-secondary institutions may use FRDR to publish their data.

A <a href="https://demo.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/?locale=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo version</a> of the FRDR site is available for training and testing purposes. The FRDR demo can be used to learn about the platform's search and data deposit features. As much as possible, the demo will be kept up-to-date with the latest version of the FRDR platform. Please note that all data deposited into the demo will be considered "test" data and will only be available temporarily.

## Purpose
FRDR will address a longstanding gap in Canada's research infrastructure by providing a single platform from which research data can be **ingested, curated, preserved, discovered, cited and shared**.

The platform's federated search tool will provide a focal point to discover and access Canadian research data, while the range of services provided by FRDR will help researchers store and manage their data, preserve their research for future use, and comply with institutional and funding agency data management requirements.

## Project Timeline

* January 2016: The software development project was started, following an earlier pilot project that identified scalability and preservation as key elements of the service that was needed.
* September 2016: Alpha testing of the user interfaces was started thanks to the contribution of discovery interface code developed by the University of British Columbia.
* April 2017: Beta testing was started and the project was put in limited production mode with a small number of research groups.
* August 2019: CANARIE announced $2M of funding to CARL Portage, of which a portion is going towards moving FRDR into full production.
* September 2020: Funding in support of the development of FRDR is administered  through the New Digital Research Infrastructure Organization (NDRIO).
* February 2021: FRDR’s repository services launched in full production!


## Geodisy Project

FRDR’s Geodisy map search (beta) is an open source discovery tool that allows users to find open data from Canadian researchers by using an interactive map. Research data
can be hard to find, and even harder when looking for data about a specific area or place. Geodisy changes that, giving users a window into the world of research data with straightforward map-based tools. Currently in beta, the map search includes datasets from [repositories indexed by FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/discover/html/repository-list.html?lang=en) with bounding box metadata. Dataverse repository datasets with location metadata and/or geospatial files are also included. FRDR’s Geodisy will continue to expand upon its collection to include more datasets from FRDR’s source list of institutional repositories
