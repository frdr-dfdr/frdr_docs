## 2. Getting Globus Connect Software
Depositing data in FRDR requires the use of [Globus Connect software](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect).

If the data is on a computer or an external hard drive, follow the steps provided on the Globus website to download, install, and configure [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) on your machine.

If the data is on your institutional or laboratory server, contact your network or system administrators to obtain the Globus Endpoint name for the server you are using. A Globus Connect Endpoint is the physical location where your files currently reside. If your institution or laboratory does not have a Globus Endpoint installed on their server, have them contact [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).


## 3. Getting Authorization to Submit
Since users can choose which Globus account they will use (e.g., affiliated with Google, Compute Canada, etc.), that choice needs to be passed on to the FRDR operations staff so they can assign authorization to deposit data to FRDR.

1. After you have signed into FRDR, find your email / account listed under "Primary Identity" on the [account page here](https://globus.frdr.ca/globus-app/account?locale=en-us). It could be like any of the following:
2. username@computecanada.ca
3. 0000-0002-1342-3550@ORCID.org
4. username@globusid.org
5. username@gmail.com
6. [Click here to send email to support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca) and include the account name you found above. Also include the name of any special storage group to which you are requesting authorization to submit.
7. If you are eligible to deposit, you will receive an email from "noreply@globusonline.org" inviting you to the authorization group with the subject "You are invited to join FRDR Depositors - Déposants DFDR"... that will say something like the following:
8. ```ccrdmdev has invited you to join the group "FRDR Depositors - Déposants DFDR". Some additional information may be required -- Click here to apply for membership.```

9. After you click on the link in the email message "Click here to apply for membership" you will be able to submit items to FRDR.
