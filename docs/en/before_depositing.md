Preparation is needed before starting a dataset submission to FRDR. This section will cover the following topics: [1) Who can deposit in FRDR](before_depositing.md#1-who-can-deposit-in-frdr), [2) Getting a Globus Account](before_depositing.md#2-getting-a-globus-account), [3) Getting authorization to submit data](before_depositing.md#3-getting-authorization-to-submit), and [4) Getting Globus Connect Software](before_depositing.md#4-getting-globus-connect-software).

## 1. Who can deposit in FRDR?

Anyone may use FRDR to search for and download datasets. You do not need to have a Globus Account affiliated with a Canadian postsecondary institution to download datasets in FRDR using Globus.

Faculty members or librarians, or their appointed designates, from a Canadian postsecondary institution may deposit data in FRDR. Faculty can sponsor designates, for example, external collaborators, graduate students, non-research staff, postdoctoral fellows, research assistants, researchers, undergraduate students, and visiting faculty, to submit data on their behalf. Requests for deposit from other types of “Canadian researchers” (e.g., government or NGOs) who are not sponsored by a faculty member will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

If you are unsure whether you are eligible to deposit in FRDR, please contact [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca)

## 2. Getting a Globus Account

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Amj-RpT_y2c/" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

There are four options that you can use to obtain a Globus Account: 1) using an institutional log in from a Canadian postsecondary institution, 2) a Compute Canada account, 3) an ORCiD, or 4) signing up directly for a Globus ID. You may also sign up for an account using Google; however, this is not preferred and will require additional verification. **In order to facilitate verification, we strongly encourage you to use an email address from a Canadian postsecondary institution.**

[Click here](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/PublishDashboard) to log in with an existing account, or to create a new account. You will need to select your institution or Compute Canada from the drop down list. If your institution does not appear in the drop down list, you will have to select a different option. If you want to use your ORCiD, it must be affiliated with an email address from a Canadian postsecondary institution.

If none of the above options work for you, [click here to create an account](https://www.globusid.org/create) directly with Globus using your institutional email address and return to the FRDR [log in](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/PublishDashboard) page when you have an account.

## 3. Getting Authorization to Submit

The first time you log into FRDR, you will be taken to a web form asking you to provide information about your department (optional), your role within your organization, and your faculty Sponsor (if applicable). This will help us to verify that you are eligible to deposit in FRDR. After you submit your application, you will receive a welcome email letting you know that your account is being verified by FRDR staff. This process may take up to two business days. If you are approved, we will email you an invitation to deposit. **If you do not receive either of these emails, please check your spam folder.**

If you are unsure whether you are eligible to deposit in FRDR, please contact [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca)

## 4. Getting Globus Connect Software

Depositing data in FRDR requires the use of [Globus Connect software](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect).

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJYTl3yhRl4/" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

If the data is on a computer or an external hard drive, follow the steps provided on the Globus website to download, install, and configure [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) on your machine.

If the data is on your institutional or laboratory server, contact your network or system administrators to obtain the Globus Endpoint name for the server you are using. A Globus Connect Endpoint is the physical location where your files currently reside. If your institution or laboratory does not have a Globus Endpoint installed on their server, have them contact [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).
