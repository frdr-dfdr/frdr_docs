# Collection Metrics

The **Collection Analytics Dashboard** provides data-driven insights into the usage and impact of digital collections 
deposited in FRDR. You can access the Collection Dashboard directly from any collection page in FRDR. Simply navigate to
the collection page you wish to view and click the **Collection Metrics button**. This will take you to the Collection 
Dashboard, where the collection you were viewing will already be pre-selected. This dashboard is updated biweekly and 
offers multiple views of key metrics. 

Users can filter by collection and select a desired time range to explore trends. You can switch between **Overview**, 
**Usage Trends**, and **Geographic** tabs to view different aspects of collection performance.
