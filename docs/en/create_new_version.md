#Create a New Dataset Version
To update files in a published dataset, you can create a new version. FRDR will make a copy of your published dataset and give you permission to edit the copy. Once your changes are in place, the new version will go through the same curation and preservation process new datasets undergo. In most cases, as a matter of transparency to anyone who may have viewed or used your data files, the previous version of your dataset will remain available even after the new version is published.

FRDR will assign a DOI to your new version, but your original DOI will continue to function and will lead to the original dataset. FRDR will add a banner to direct end-users to the most recent version of your dataset and will link previous and new versions in the metadata record. All versions of your dataset will also include a version history table that lists the available versions and a summary of changes.

**If only metadata changes are required (e.g., to link to a published article, change author order, or augment the dataset description), or if there is an issue that necessitates completely removing a file from all versions, please contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca)**. If you need to change the files in a dataset that is under embargo or in external review (i.e., not yet publicly available), we also ask you to contact us.

If you have a very large dataset and a substantial number of changes, please contact the FRDR service team at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca). We are happy to consult with you about the best path forward.

            Depending on the size and complexity of your dataset, it may take time for FRDR to copy your dataset for versioning.

If you have questions, or if the system is taking longer than expected to copy your dataset, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca">support@frdr-dfdr.ca</a>.

            When you create a new version, FRDR will automatically copy all of the files from the previous version of your dataset into the new version. You can safely modify the file set in your new version, and the published version of your dataset will remain unchanged. For example, you can add new files, remove files that are no longer necessary, or overwrite files with an updated version. If there is no change to a particular file, you can leave it as-is in the new version, and it will appear in both the previous and current versions of your dataset.

        <div class="mb-3">
            If you are changing many files, we recommend using Globus transfer settings to help manage your updates. You can find these under “Transfer & Timer Options” on the Globus File Manager screen. For example, you can opt to only transfer new or modified files from the source (your local copy) into FRDR. You can also opt to delete files at the destination (that is your new version in FRDR) that do not exist at the source (your local copy). You can find more information about transferring data into FRDR via Globus in the <a href="/docs/en/depositing_data/">Depositing Data</a> section of our documentation, or in <a href="https://docs.globus.org/guides/tutorials/manage-files/transfer-files/">Globus docs</a> .
