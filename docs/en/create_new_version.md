Creating a new version in FRDR enables you to modify the files and metadata of your published dataset while maintaining its history. The existing metadata and files will be copied from the previous version to a new version making it as easy as possible to create a new version. When you are finished with your changes it will then go through the same curation and preservation process that a new dataset receives.

If only metadata changes (e.g. title, authors etc.) are required contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).

If you need to change the files in a dataset that isn't published or is under embargo contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca) and we will assist you in making the changes.

## Create a new version
You can create a new version of a published dataset either from the Publication Dashboard or from the landing page of the dataset.

From the [Publication Dashboard](/repo/PublishDashboard) you can create a new version of a dataset by finding the dataset in the "Published" tab and clicking on the "New Version" button.

From the landing page of the dataset you can find the "New Version" button at the very bottom of the page.

## Add a public summary of the version
For each new version you create you can add a "Public Summary of Changes" which will be shown in the version history. It is optional and limited to 2000 characters. It's purpose is to help downloaders understand the differences between versions. When you are done entering your summary click on the "Create" button.

## Edit New Version's Metadata
Editing the new version's metadata will be the same steps as entering the metadata in a new dataset except all of the previous metadata will be copied into this new version.

## Make changes to new version's files
When you create a new version FRDR will automatically copy all of the files from the previous version of your dataset to the new version. An email will be sent to you when this copy is completed. On this new copy you will be able to safely modify, delete or keep the files from your previous version. If FRDR hasn't completed making this copy of the files it will ask you come back at a later time to make your changes.

## Verify and finish your new version
Verify that the metadata looks correct and click the finish button to send your new dataset to the curation team.

Upon publication of the new version there will be a version history table of every version in your dataset displaying your public summary. There will also be a warning at the top of the landing pages for old versions that this isn't the most recent version of this dataset with a link to your new version.

If you have any questions or concerns about the versioning process contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).
