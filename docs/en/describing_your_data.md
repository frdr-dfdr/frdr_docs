## Required Metadata

*Title*: The full title by which the dataset is known.

_Examples_:
* Acoustic recordings of North Atlantic right whale upcalls in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
* Impacts of the Husky oil spill on gut microbiota of native fish species to the North Saskatchewan River

*Description*: Provide a summary describing the purpose, nature, and scope of the dataset.

_Example_:
* “This file contains collated data of the AHR1 ligand binding domain subtypes, embryonic dioxin EC50 values, and 17 life history traits for 89 avian species. The traits included in this dataset are indicative of each species's developmental rate, fecundity, level of contaminant depuration into the egg, body size, longevity, migration strategy, range, habitat type, trophic level, and degree of sociality and sexual competition. Most birds in this dataset are North American species. These data are associated with the article, "Species traits predict the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 (AHR1) subtypes responsible for dioxin sensitivity in birds" by Bianchini and Morrissey (2020). The data were used to investigate the relationship between species traits, phylogeny, and AHR1 subtypes in birds.” (doi:10.20383/101.0257)

* *Other*: Any person or institution making a significant contribution to the development and/or maintenance of the resource, but whose contribution does not “fit” one of the other contributor types.

*Related Identifiers*: Provide links to resources related to the dataset. If a DOI (digital object identifier) is available, provide the DOI (e.g. [https://doi.org/10.1000/182]()); otherwise, a URL is sufficient. For each related resource, select the relationship between the dataset and the related resource from the dropdown menu.

_Example_:
* **this dataset is cited by**: [https://doi.org/10.1000/182]()

*Relation types:*
* *this dataset is cited by*: The dataset is cited by the related resource. Typically, this means that the related resource includes the dataset in a formal citation. Since publications have varying practices for data citation, FRDR’s definition includes both formal citations and other  and other links to the dataset (for example, in a “data availability” section or in the body of the paper). In general, this option should be selected for publications that analyze the dataset.
* *this dataset cites*: The dataset cites the related resource. This includes related resources that are listed in the README file (for example, a paper describing a data collection methodology).
* *this dataset is a supplement to*: The dataset supplements the related resource. This includes publications that analyze the dataset, but do _not_ cite the dataset (for example, if the paper was published before the dataset was made available in FRDR).
* *this dataset is supplemented by*: The dataset is supplemented by the related resource (or, the related resource is “supplementary material” to the dataset). For example, software used to analyze the data may be considered supplementary material.
* *this dataset is part/subset of*: The dataset is a part, or subset, of the related resource. For example, the dataset is part of a larger series.
* *this dataset has part/subset*: The dataset **has a part, or subset**, represented by the related resource (or, the related resource is a part or subset of the dataset). For example, the related resource is a portion of the dataset.
* *this dataset is derived from*: The dataset **is derived from** the related resource. For example, the dataset could be aggregate data summarizing survey data (the related resource), or produced by analyzing the related resource.
* *this dataset is the source of*: The dataset **is the source of** the related resource (or, the related resource is derived from the dataset). For example, the related resource was produced by analyzing the dataset.

## Geographical Metadata
