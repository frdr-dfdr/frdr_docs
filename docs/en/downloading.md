# Downloading Datasets 

# Finding Datasets
If you do not have a direct link to a FRDR-hosted dataset you can browse through available datasets using the 
[FRDR Discovery Engine](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/discover/html/discovery-ui.html?q=*&Collection=FRDR).

# Finding the File Listing for a Dataset

The file browsing widget for a dataset is near the bottom of the dataset landing page. Each individual file is hyperlinked
and can be clicked on to be downloaded.

# Downloading Dotasets with a Web Browser

Downloading datasets with a web browser from FRDR works like downloading any other file from the Web. Simply click on 
the name of the file displayed in FRDR's file browsing widget to download it to your device. There are several limitations to this method:

* Files must be downloaded individually.
* The speed and reliability of Web transfers will not be as good as when using Globus Transfer. We recommend using Globus Transfer for datasets over 5GB in size, depending on your Internet speed.
* Some directories may contain too many files to be listed efficiently in a web browser and will need Globus Transfer to see the whole directory listing.

# Downloading Dotasets with Globus Transfer

Globus Transfer is a free program that allows for reliable, high-speed transfers and is the best method for downloading
large amounts of data from FRDR. To use Globus Transfer:

1. Download and install [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) for your device if you do not have access to a system with Globus Transfer already installed.
2. Click on the 'Download Dataset' button under the file browsing widget, and, once the Globus
Transfer interface opens in a new window, select your endpoint in the Collection field of the pane opposite of the FRDR pane.

3. You can now download the dataset to any location on your device.
