## Finding Datasets
If you do not have a direct link to a FRDR-hosted dataset you can browse through available datasets using the 
[FRDR Discovery](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/search).

## Finding the File Listing for a Dataset and Downloading with a Web Browser

The file browsing widget for a dataset is near the bottom of the dataset landing page.

Downloading datasets with a web browser from FRDR works like downloading any other file from the Web. Simply click on 
the name of the file displayed in FRDR's file browsing widget to download it to your device. There are several limitations to this method:

* Files must be downloaded individually.
* The speed and reliability of Web transfers will not be as good as when using Globus Transfer. We recommend using Globus Transfer for datasets over 10GB in size.
* Some directories may contain too many files to be listed efficiently in a web browser and will need Globus Transfer to see the whole directory listing.

## Downloading Datasets with Globus Transfer

Globus Transfer is a free program that allows for reliable, high-speed file transfers and is the best method for downloading
large amounts of data from FRDR. To use Globus Transfer, you either need access to a system with 
Globus Transfer pre-installed, such as most Digital Research Alliance of Canada hosts, or to setup your own Globus account and install 
[Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal) for your device. 

The two videos below go through the steps to get a working Globus Transfer endpoint and using it to get files from FRDR :
