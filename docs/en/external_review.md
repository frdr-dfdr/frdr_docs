Datasets can be shared with an external reviewer before they are fully published.  External reviewers do not need accounts in FRDR.

## Starting the External Review Process

During dataset submission the submitter will be presented with a question on the access tab: "Will this dataset need a review period?"  To start the process they answer **yes** to this question.  Please note that this forces the dataset to have an embargo period, so the "embargo date" and "embargo reason" will also need to be supplied.  External review invitations can be sent out and reviewers can view the dataset using those invitations until the embargo date has passed, after which the dataset will be fully public.

## Inviting Reviewers

Reviewers can be sent invitations to review a dataset once the external review process has been requested.  Find the dataset under the "Embargo" tab and click the "Manage Reviewers".  The invitation form will be shown at the top of the page.  Fill out the form and click the "Invite" button.

## Anonymous Review

On the invitation form there is a checkbox for Anonymous Review.  If this is selected then a new part of the form will open up with a list of metadata that can be hidden from the reviewer.

Select the visibility of the metadata as needed for this review. Note that the metadata available on the public landing page for this dataset is restricted to the title while the dataset is under embargo.

## Editing the Dataset

During the review process changes may need to be made to the dataset. This needs to be done by working with a curator. You can click the "revise" button for any dataset under embargo to request changes to a dataset.

## Finishing the Review

If all reviews are complete and the embargo can be removed please use the <a href="/contactus">contact us</a> form and ask a curator to review the embargo.
