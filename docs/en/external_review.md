Datasets can be shared with an external reviewer before they are published.  External reviewers do not need accounts in FRDR.

## Starting the External Review Process

At the end of a dataset submission the submitter will be presented with a question: "Does this dataset need external review?"  To start the process they simply answer **yes** to this question and then click the finish button.

## Inviting Reviewers

Reviewers can be sent invitations to review a dataset once the external review process has been requested.  Find the dataset under the "External Review" tab and click the "Manage Reviewers".  The invitation form will be shown at the top of the page.  Fill out the form and click the "Invite" button.

## Blind Review

On the invitation form there is a checkbox for Blind Review.  If this is selected then a new part of the form will open up with a list of metadata that can be hidden from the reviewer.

Select the visibility of the metadata as needed for this review.

## Editing the Dataset

During the review process changes may need to be made to the dataset.  To edit the dataset, find the dataset under the "External Review" tab and click the Edit button for that dataset. Note that editing a dataset will expire all existing review invitations and reviewers will need to be sent another invitation if they should review the dataset again before it is published.

## Finalizing the Dataset

After the review is done, find the dataset under the "External Review" tab and click the Finish button for that dataset.  This will send the dataset into the curation workflow, where it will be reviewed by a curator as part of the normal process before it is published.
