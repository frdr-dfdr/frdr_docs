Datasets can be shared with an external reviewer before they are fully published.  External reviewers do not need accounts in FRDR.

## Starting the External Review Process

During dataset submission the submitter will be presented with a question on the access tab: "Will this dataset need a review period?"  To start the process they answer **yes** to this question.  Please note that this forces the dataset to have an embargo period, so the "embargo date" and "embargo reason" will also need to be supplied.  External review invitations can be sent out and reviewers can view the dataset using those invitations until the embargo date has passed, after which the dataset will be fully published.

## Inviting Reviewers

Reviewers can be sent invitations to review a dataset once the external review process has been requested.  Find the dataset under the "Embargo" tab and click the "Manage Reviewers".  The invitation form will be shown at the top of the page.  Fill out the form and click the "Invite" button.

## Blind Review

On the invitation form there is a checkbox for Blind Review.  If this is selected then a new part of the form will open up with a list of metadata that can be hidden from the reviewer.

</a>

Select the visibility of the metadata as needed for this review.  Please note that the dataset landing page is not available to the general public while it is under embargo and going through review, so regardless of the setting for blind review the metadata will not be publicly viewable.

## Editing the Dataset

During the review process changes may need to be made to the dataset.  This needs to be done by working with a curator.  Please <a href="/contactus">contact us</a> and sending them the details of what needs to be changed. If changes need to be made to any of the dataset files they will follow up with directions on how to do that.

## Finishing the Review

If all reviews are complete and the embargo can be removed please use the <a href="/contactus">contact us</a> form and ask a curator to review the embargo.
