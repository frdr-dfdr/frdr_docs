### 1. Who can use FRDR?
Anyone may use FRDR to search for and download datasets.

Principal Investigators (PIs), or their appointed designates, from any and all domains or subject areas may submit Content to FRDR. PIs must be faculty at an eligible Canadian institution. PIs can sponsor designates, for example, external collaborators, graduate students, non-research staff, postdoctoral fellows, research assistants, researchers, undergraduate students, and visiting faculty, to submit Content on their behalf. Requests for deposit from other types of “Canadian researchers” (e.g., government or NGOs) who are not sponsored by a PI will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Please refer to the Data Submission Policy for more information

### 2. How can I measure the impact of my datasets?
Various statistics are available for data submitted to FRDR, including the number of views and file downloads. To access these stats, navigate to the dataset landing page and click on the “View item statistics” button at the bottom of the record.

### 3. Why is there not a complete French language version?
The fully French version is coming soon.
FRDR already has bilingual interfaces for the Search and Deposit functions.

As a result of our partnership with Globus, they have internationalized their pages for Globus login and consent. Globus has also worked with us to make improvements to the Search function. They are currently making substantial changes to the Globus Transfer web app interface, including internationalization, which will be available in the near future. 

The FRDR help documentation and Terms of Use will be available in both English and French when FRDR launches in full production. 

### 4. After I submit my dataset, when will it be searchable?
There are several things that need to happen after you submit your dataset before it will be searchable:

* The transfer of your data files to FRDR must be complete. This can take some time for large datasets.
* After submission, Curators are informed that they need to review and approve your submission. Curators have other responsibilities in addition to reviewing FRDR submissions, and so this process may take some time. You can expect to be contacted by a Curator within 48 hours of data submission.
* You will receive an email confirming the approval of your dataset.
* Once a dataset has been approved, the metadata for your dataset needs to be indexed. This might take up to 20 minutes.

### 5. How can I add or change a data file after I submit?
A feature of FRDR is assurance of the provenance of the data in the repository—that the data remains as submitted by the researcher. Only authorized FRDR curators can make changes to submitted data.

To request any change to data you submitted, send an email to [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca) and your message will be forwarded to an appropriate curator. A change to the data may require a new DOI for the dataset.

### 6. How can I change the metadata for a dataset after I submit?
To request any change to submitted metadata, send an email to [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca) and your message will be forwarded to an appropriate curator.

### 7. Can I deposit data to FRDR and have it stored in my Province/institution?
Yes, a design feature of FRDR is that data storage locations can be “federated.” An institution can apply to host a storage group that will be added to FRDR. The institution does not need to be running FRDR, just a Globus endpoint. If you are a representative of an institution and would like to apply to host a storage group, please contact [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).

### 8. What limitations are there for preservation (automatic archiving of data submitted)?
Currently, we can process submissions smaller than 4 TB. If you need a larger dataset preserved by [Archivematica](https://www.archivematica.org/en/) please contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).

### 9. Why can't I download a file via HTTP?
It might be for a few reasons:
* A browser cannot download a folder or hierarchy via HTTP.
* We have a maximum file size of 10 GB for HTTP download.
* Different web browsers view certain file types differently, and people have different browser settings.

### 10. Cross-referencing of datasets and other research outputs.
If you have several related datasets, or research outputs such as publications, you are able to cross reference these with the data you are adding to FRDR. 

To do so, use the Related Identifier metadata field to add the DOIs of related datasets. If you are in the process of submitting more than one dataset, note that DOIs are assigned as soon as you start a dataset deposit. As such, you will have their DOIs available to use as Related Identifiers for concurrent submissions.

If you have other research outputs, for example a journal article, that you want to relate to your dataset, use the Related Identifier metadata field to add its DOI or citation. 

Alternatively, you can contact a Curator at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca) to add metadata such as  Related Identifiers.

### 11. What tool can I use to calculate checksums?
There is a free tool to calculate SHA-256 checksums here: https://quickhash-gui.org/

### 12. Can I get a DOI before my dataset is deposited?
Yes, start the process to deposit your dataset, and then select "Save and exit.” The DOI for your in-progress deposit will be shown in the list of incomplete deposits. Please note that the DOI will not be resolvable until after your deposit is approved for publication.

### 13. How long do I have to complete a deposit?
Session timeout is 60 minutes, which means that as long as you are moving to the next screen in under 60 minutes, you will not have a problem. If you need to take longer than that, you should save your progress and come back to it after you have your text ready to copy and paste.
