                    Principal Investigators (PIs) from any research discipline, and their sponsored designates, may submit content to FRDR. PIs must be a faculty member, librarian, or community-based researcher at an institution or organization eligible to receive Tri-Agency funding, including Indigenous not-for-profit organizations eligible for funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). PIs can sponsor designates to submit content on their behalf, including graduate and undergraduate students, data managers, non-research staff, external collaborators, postdoctoral fellows, and research assistants. Requests for deposit from other types of Canadian researchers (e.g. researchers affiliated with government or NGOs) who are not sponsored by a PI will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

                    Yes, you do. FRDR does not own the data you choose to publish in the repository. When you decide to deposit data within FRDR,  you grant FRDR permission to steward the copy of the data that was deposited in the repository, and you retain your ownership rights.  Please see our Data Submission Policy, <a href="/policies/en/data_submission/#60-rights-and-ownership">section 6.0 Rights and Ownership</a> for further information.

                    After you submit your dataset, it will go through our internal review, or curation process. This typically takes 2-5 business days. Once approved for publication, your DOI will be registered with DataCite and your data will be indexed for discovery, unless you have selected an embargo to delay discovery.

                    Yes, a design feature of FRDR is that data storage locations can be “federated.” An institution can apply to host a storage group that will be added to FRDR. The institution does not need to be running FRDR, just a Globus endpoint. If you are a representative of an institution and would like to apply to host a storage group, please contact <a href="mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca">support@frdr-dfdr.ca</a> .

                    You are welcome to include code or scripts you used to process or analyze your data alongside that data in FRDR, however, you may wish to use a repository that is purpose built for code and software with version control and software-appropriate license options.

                    If you would like a DOI for your software, code can be pushed from GitHub to Zenodo. Information about that process is available in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content">GitHub docs</a> . Once a GitHub repository is hooked to Zenodo, new releases in GitHub will automatically trigger a new version in Zenodo. Most publicly available repositories can also be pushed to the Software Heritage Archive, which will provide you with a unique identifier called a SWHID that you can use to cite specific versions of your code. See their webpage “<a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/save-reference-research-software/">Save and Reference Research Software</a> ” for more details.

                    Your dataset can be edited while it is under external review, however, you will need to work with a member of our curation team to implement changes. To request changes to the metadata record or the data files, please log in. Your datasets in review will be listed in the “Under Embargo” tab on your FRDR publication dashboard. Click the “Revise” button next to the dataset title. From there, you can initiate modifications to the embargo, metadata, and files as needed. If you wish to provide additional notes to the curator, you have the option to do so. Once you have submitted the form, your request will be sent to the curation team with the details of what needs to be changed.

                    In order to ensure all datasets submitted to FRDR are preserved where appropriate, FRDR has implemented an appraisal process to ensure long-term access is managed responsibly and sustainably. All datasets deposited with FRDR will be considered for long-term preservation. Please note that the repository appraisal process takes documentation and file format into account, and datasets lacking adequate documentation or stored in proprietary formats may not be selected for long-term preservation activities or may be reappraised in future. Datasets not selected for long-term preservation will continue to be accessible via FRDR as per the <a href="/policies/en/data_retention/">Data Retention and Deaccession Policy</a> and <a href="/policies/en/terms_of_use/">Terms of Use</a>.

                    Yes. Until your new version is approved for publication, it will count against your FRDR quota (your storage allocation). After your new version is published, only those files that were changed or added to the new version will count against your allocation. Files that are identical to those in the previous version will not further reduce your quota.

                    You can check your remaining quota in your Dashboard.

We will also link versions in the metadata record and display a version history table on each data landing page that lists the available versions and a summary of changes.
