The Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) is a **bilingual** publishing platform for **sharing** and **preserving** Canadian research data. Our mission is to facilitate the findability, accessibility, and reuse of Canadian research data, and to act as a leader in the stewardship of Canadian research data.

## Why use FRDR
FRDR provides a range of services to help researchers store and manage their data, preserve their research for future use, and comply with journal and funder data sharing requirements. We are a **curated, general-purpose repository**, custom built for **large datasets**, and open to Canadian researchers in **any discipline**. 

For more information, please see [our features](features.md) list. If you have questions about the FRDR platform or our service, please contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).

## Who can use FRDR
Anyone can use FRDR to search for and download data, and Principal Investigators (PIs), or their sponsored designates, may [create a FRDR account](before_depositing.md) and deposit data for publication. PIs must be a faculty member, librarian, or community-based researcher at an institution or organization eligible to receive Tri-Agency funding, including Indigenous not-for-profit organizations eligible for funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). Sponsored designates include external collaborators, graduate and undergraduate students, data managers, non-research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and research assistants.

Requests for deposit from other types of Canadian researchers (e.g. researchers affiliated with government or NGOs) who are not sponsored by a PI will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Please refer to the [Data Submission Policy](/policies/en/data_submission/) for more information, or contact FRDR at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).
