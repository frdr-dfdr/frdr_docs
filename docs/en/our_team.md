## Our mission
The Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) is a **bilingual** publishing platform for **sharing** and **preserving** Canadian research data. Our mission is to facilitate the findability, accessibility, and reuse of Canadian research data, and to act as a leader in the stewardship of Canadian research data.

### Why use FRDR
FRDR provides a range of services to help researchers store and manage their data, preserve their research for future use, and comply with journal and funder data sharing requirements. We are a **curated, general-purpose repository**, custom built for **large datasets**, and open to Canadian researchers in **any discipline**. 

For more information, please see [our features](about.md#our-features) list. If you have questions about the FRDR platform or our service, please contact us at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).

### Who can use FRDR
Anyone can use FRDR to search for and download data, and Principal Investigators (PIs), or their sponsored designates, may [create a FRDR account](before_depositing.md) and deposit data for publication. PIs must be a faculty member, librarian, or community-based researcher at an institution or organization eligible to receive Tri-Agency funding, including Indigenous not-for-profit organizations eligible for funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). Sponsored designates include external collaborators, graduate and undergraduate students, data managers, non-research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and research assistants.

Requests for deposit from other types of Canadian researchers (e.g. researchers affiliated with government or NGOs) who are not sponsored by a PI will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Please refer to the [Data Submission Policy](/policies/en/data_submission/) for more information, or contact FRDR at [support@frdr-dfdr.ca](mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca).

## Our journey
* January 2016: The software development project was started, following an earlier pilot project that identified scalability and preservation as key elements of the repository service that was needed.
* September 2016: Alpha testing of the user interfaces was started thanks to the contribution of discovery interface code developed by the University of British Columbia.
* April 2017: Beta testing was started and the project was put in limited production mode with a small number of research groups.
* August 2019: CANARIE announced $2M of funding to the Canadian Association of Research Libraries Portage Network, of which a portion was dedicated to moving FRDR into full production.
* April 2020: Geodisy map-based search functionality added to FRDR.
* September 2020: Funding in support of the development of FRDR is administered through the New Digital Research Infrastructure Organization (NDRIO), now the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.
* February 2021: FRDR’s repository services launched in full production!
* March 2022: Discovery redesign work to integrate text- and map-based search.
* March 2023: FRDR repository and discovery split off, with discovery service relaunched as Lunaris.
