The following document sets forth the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for use of the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) website (the Site),  [www.frdr-dfdr.ca](http://www.frdr-dfdr.ca) and the services available on or at the Site (taken together, the Service). The Service is offered by Compute Canada and the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL). The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein (the Terms of Use) and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on this by Compute Canada and CARL. Use of the Service denotes agreement with the following terms.

# 1.0  Definitions

**Content**: Data and associated material (e.g., metadata records, software code, ReadMe text, etc.).

**Curator**: An individual who has responsibility for managing a set of content in the Service. This may include but is not limited to making acceptance decisions on submission, auditing and improving metadata, and migrating the content if necessary.

**Personal Information (PI)**:  [*Personal Information Protection Act of British Columbia (SBC 2003)*](<http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/00_03063_01>) defines PI as information about an identifiable individual and includes employee personal information but does not include a) contact information, or b) work product information. PI will be used in relation to any information collected about Users and Submitters through their use of the Service.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**: The Canadian Tri-Council defines PII as information about an individual that may reasonably be expected to identify an individual when used alone or combined with other available information (Tri-Council Policy Statement:  [*Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans - TCPS 2 (2018)*](<http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2018.html>)). This definition will be used in relation to any Content submitted to the Service.

**Submitter**: An individual who publishes Content to the Service. It is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the Submitter will be an author of the associated dataset or a researcher collaborating with the author(s).

**User**: An individual who makes use of the Service by either browsing the Site or downloading Content.

# 2.0  Submitter Agreement
Submitters of Content to the Service agree to the following:

* The Submitter is an individual (i.e., not a corporate entity) at least 13 years of age. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Service (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).

* The Submitter certifies that they are legally permitted to use the Service and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Service.
 
* The Submitter is responsible for ensuring that Content is suitable for open dissemination, and that it complies with these Terms of Use, research ethics agreements, and applicable laws, including, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity or other right of any other of any third party; laws related to defamation or obscenity; privacy laws, in particular, provisions pertaining to Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, Compute Canada and CARL shall not be responsible for ensuring that Content submitted to the Service adheres to these conditions. If PII is discovered in Content submitted to the Service, a Curator will undertake reasonable efforts to notify the Submitter.

* At the time of submission, Submitters may decide if their Content will be public or embargoed.

   * Public Content is both openly accessible and discoverable through search. Public Content will be assigned a DOI and subject to preservation procedures.
   * Submitters may also request that public Content be embargoed for a period that shall not exceed two years, after which point the Content will become publicly accessible. Submitters must provide adequate reasoning for the embargo request, for example, if making Content publicly accessible would jeopardise a forthcoming publication. Embargo requests must have an explicit termination date and will be granted at the discretion of a Curator. Content for which the metadata itself is considered sensitive should not be submitted to the Service.
   
* Submitters are responsible for providing sufficient metadata and contextual information to ensure that Content may be adequately understood and easily reused.

This includes, but is not limited to, the creation of copies, back-ups, and alteration of the data for the purposes of preservation.

* After submission of Content to the Service, Submitters will no longer be able to directly edit, alter, augment, or remove the dataset. Changes, including the removal of Content, may be requested through the process outlined in section 5.0 of this policy.

* Compute Canada and CARL will endeavor to maintain the availability of Content over the long term, but may alter or remove Content subject to curation and retention policies.

* Compute Canada and CARL reserve the right, without notice, at their discretion and without liability, to alter or delete Content that violates these Terms of Use or applicable laws.

**The Submitter hereby represents and warrants that they are lawfully entitled and have full authority to license Compute Canada and CARL to use the Content in the ways described in these Terms and Conditions; and are not under any obligation or restriction created by law, contract or otherwise that would prevent them from entering into and fully performing these Terms and Conditions.**

## 7.2   Collection of Personal Information
