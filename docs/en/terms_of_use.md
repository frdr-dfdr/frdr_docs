All Submitters agree to the following:

* The Submitter hereby confirms that they are legally permitted to use the Service, eligible to submit Content to the Service per the FRDR Data Submission Policy, and takes full responsibility for their use of the Service.

* The Submitter acknowledges that they are required to create an account with Globus in order to submit Content to the Service, which is subject to the Globus [Terms of Service](https://www.globus.org/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.globus.org/legal/privacy).

* The Submitter is solely responsible for ensuring that Content is suitable for open dissemination, and that it complies with these Terms of Use, the FRDR Collections Development Policy, research ethics agreements, and applicable laws.

* In addition to the above, the Submitter represents, warrants and covenants, and can demonstrate to the Service Host’s full satisfaction upon request, that:

    * the Submitter owns or otherwise has the right to grant the rights and licenses to the Content contemplated by these Terms of Use;

    * the Submitter is not under any obligation or restriction created by law, contract or otherwise that would prevent them from entering into and fully performing these Terms of Use;

Submitters must also select the license terms under which the Content will be provided for public access, being either one of the open license options offered during the Content submission process or, subject to Curator approval, custom license terms. By default Content is made available under the [Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Submitters may request that public Content be embargoed for a period that will not exceed one year, unless otherwise approved by the Service Manager. Submitters must provide adequate reasoning for any embargo request, for example, if making Content publicly accessible would jeopardise a forthcoming publication. Embargo requests must have an explicit termination date. Embargo requests of one year or shorter will be granted at the discretion of a Curator. After the embargo period, the Content will become publicly accessible, unless otherwise mandated by data protection and privacy law.</section>

Submitter has the authority or consent to disclose that Personal Information to the Service Host and to the public via the Service.

* Submitters are responsible for providing sufficient metadata and contextual information to ensure that Content may be adequately understood and easily reused.

* Submitters and their licensors retain all ownership rights to their Content. By submitting Content to the Service, the Submitter hereby grants the Service Host a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, the creation of copies, back-ups, and alteration of the data for the purposes of preservation. The Submitter further authorizes the Service Host to migrate the Content to any medium or format for the purpose of preservation.

* The Submitter agrees to pay all royalties, fees, remuneration and any other monies due or payable arising from any use of the Content or the exercise of the rights granted in respect of the Content to the Service Host, Users or other third parties on or through the Service, including where the Submitter does not have the required rights to grant the licenses and rights described in these Terms of Use.

* After submission of Content to the Service, Submitters will no longer be able to directly edit, withdraw from public access or remove the Content. Changes, including the withdrawal or removal of Content, may be requested through the process outlined in section 6.0 of these Terms of Use.

## 4.0 Publication of Content
For Content that is hosted on the Service, the Service Host will use commercially reasonable efforts to:

* review submissions and, where necessary, work with Submitters to ensure that Content contains sufficient metadata and contextual information to be adequately understood and easily reused.

The Service Host will not be responsible for ensuring that Content submitted to the Service adheres to any requirements set out in these Terms of Use. The Service Host reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or review the Content submitted to the Service. If Personal Information, not previously identified, is discovered in Content submitted to the Service, a Curator will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Submitter.

The Service Host reserves the right, without notice, at their discretion and without liability, to alter, withdraw from public access or remove Content that violates these Terms of Use or applicable laws. If Content is withdrawn from public access or removed for a violation of these Terms of Use or applicable laws, the Service Host may, in their sole discretion, retain a searchable record of such Content in the Service, including the metadata associated with that Content and reasons for removing or withdrawing access.

## 5.0 User Responsibilities

Users of the Service will:

* provide proper attribution and citation for the Content in adherence to the academic integrity norms of their field or discipline;

## 6.0 Requests for Withdrawal, Removal, or Alteration of Content

Once Content has been submitted to the Service, Submitters may no longer directly alter, withdraw from public access or remove Content from the Service. Such requests are to be considered by curation support staff and will be granted at the discretion of a Curator.

All requests to temporarily or permanently withdraw from public access or remove Content from the Service must be made to the Service Host.

### 9.3 Liability and Indemnity

To the extent not prohibited by law, the Service Host will not be liable for any damages whatsoever, including direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, consequential or exemplary damages arising from, relating to or connected with:

* the use or inability to use the Site, Service or Content;

If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

### 9.6 Changes to Terms of Use

The Service Host reserves the right, at their sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms of Use at any time, in which case the modified or updated Terms of Use will supersede prior versions.
