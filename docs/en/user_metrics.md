The Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) utilizes [Tableau software](https://www.tableau.com/why-tableau/what-is-tableau) to consolidate and present platform statistics. These statistics are primarily open to the public and can be accessed by navigating to 'Site Metrics' located in the website's header. 

To access metrics for an individual item, use the “View items statistics” button at the bottom of each data landing page.
