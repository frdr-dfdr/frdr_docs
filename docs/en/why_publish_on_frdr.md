# Why Publish on FRDR?

Many journals and funders have data publishing requirements in place, and generalist data repositories help researchers fulfill these requirements. The Federated Research Data Repository, or FRDR, is recommended by Canada’s Tri-Agency funding programs in the [Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy (2021)](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy) FAQs and supports researchers in meeting these obligations. This page provides information on how it contributes to the landscape.

        <h2 id="common-criteria-for-data-repositories-from-journals">Common Criteria for Data Repositories from Journals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Datasets are openly accessible:</strong> Anyone can search for and download datasets from FRDR, regardless of geographic location or affiliation, without creating an account on FRDR. For very large datasets, we recommend creating an account to facilitate file transfer using Globus Connect Personal. </li>
            <li><strong>Persistent identifiers:</strong> FRDR assigns a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to each published dataset. New versions also get new DOIs, so you can tell which version of a dataset was used in a paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Open licensing: </strong>By default, FRDR uses CC-BY 4.0 or CC0 licenses. Custom licenses are only used when appropriate and required (e.g. when a dataset uses data derived from data using a more restrictive license).</li>
            <li><strong>Freely accessible: </strong>FRDR does not charge end-users to access or download the data. For very large datasets, we use a third party service to support file transfer, which is also free of charge.</li>
            <li><strong>Preservation plan: </strong> FRDR provides bit-level preservation for all datasets, which are mirrored on servers in two provinces (Ontario and British Columbia). In addition, a digital preservationist appraises the datasets after they have been published, to determine what additional preservation activities should be conducted to maintain long-term accessibility and reusability of the datasets. For more information, please see our <a href="/docs/en/after_depositing/#preservation">FRDR Preservation Process</a> and <a href="/policies/en/preservation/">Preservation Policy.</a></li>
            <li><strong>Accepted by the research community: </strong>FRDR has hundreds of datasets deposited across multiple disciplines from all over Canada. More detailed information about the research community’s use of FRDR is available on our <a href="/stats/en/">site metrics page.</a></li>
            <li><strong>Included in repository registries:</strong>FRDR has entries in common Data Repository and Research service registries, including <a href="https://www.re3data.org/repository/r3d100012646">re3data.org</a> and <a href="https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.EnRBIa">FAIRsharing.org</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Generalist repository:</strong> FRDR accepts research data from researchers across Canada, including datasets that don’t fit other repositories. We accept datasets that are too large or don’t fit the structure of other data repositories in Canada.</li>

        <h2 id="additional-features-that-make-your-datasets-as-fair-and-open-as-possible">Additional features that make your datasets as FAIR and open as possible</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Curation Services:</strong>We have a team of data curators who review the data and metadata to ensure that the datasets are well described, understandable, and usable by people outside the research team, so that the dataset is as <a href="/docs/en/fair_principles/">FAIR</a> and reusable as possible. For more information, please visit our <a href="/docs/en/after_depositing/#curation">FRDR Curation page.</a></li>
            <li><strong>Versions:</strong>Sometimes data needs to be shared that is not static or complete (e.g. annual measurements). When a published dataset needs to be updated, a new version can be submitted. Each new version has its own DOI, and each new version is curated.</li>
            <li><strong>Embargoes:</strong>To support compliance with journal and funder requirements, FRDR provides optional embargoes on data and metadata, as well as <a href="/docs/en/external_review/">selective pre-publication sharing</a> with editors, colleagues, and reviewers.</li>
            <li><strong>Collections:</strong>Submitting researchers, labs, institutions, or networks may request FRDR create a custom collection. Collections are a way to organize related datasets under a shared identity or research context, providing a landing page for the related datasets. FRDR also provides impact metrics for each collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Discoverable:</strong>FRDR datasets are broadly discoverable through <a href="https://www.lunaris.ca/en">Lunaris</a> (Canada’s national data discovery service), <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google Dataset Search</a>, the <a href="https://explore.openaire.eu/">EU’s OpenAIRE</a>, <a href="https://search.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, most university libraries, and other platforms—maximizing visibility, supporting compliance, and enabling future reuse.</li>
            <li><strong>Free to submit for Canadian Researchers:</strong>Principal Investigators (PIs) from Canadian post-secondary institutions and organizations who are eligible for Tri-Agency funding—including Indigenous not-for-profit organizations—may submit datasets for publication at no cost to the researcher or the organization. PIs can additionally sponsor designates such as students, collaborators, or data managers to help with the submission. For more information, please see our <a href="/policies/en/data_submission/">Data Submission Policy.</a></li>

        <div>At this time, we only accept data submissions for datasets that are suitable for open access from researchers at Canadian organizations eligible to receive Tri-Agency funding. We have also accepted some research datasets from government or other non-profit organizations in Canada, on a case-by-case basis.</div>

        <div>Each journal and funder has their own particular requirements for data sharing. If you are depositing a dataset to adhere to specific requirements, check their requirements against this list of common criteria. If you are still unsure if we are a suitable home for your dataset, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@frdr-dfdr.ca">support@frdr-dfdr.ca.</a>
